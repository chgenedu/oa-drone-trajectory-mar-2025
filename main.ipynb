    "### Assumptions:\n",
    "* For the camera angle, we require `FOV/2 + abs(camera_angle) < 90 degrees`, otherwise an edge of the FOV will be at or above the horizon. (FOV = Field of View)\n",
    "* The camera angle will not be so big as to cause a significant distortion to the shape of the footprint. In particular, **we assume the footprint will remain rectangularly shaped**, and the camera angle will only affect the footprint's lengths parallel to either the x or y axis, but the lengths of the remaining two sides will remain relatively unchanged.\n",
    "* Only one of the angle_x_deg and angle_y_deg may be non-zero. If both angles are non-zero, then an exception will be raised when the footprint coordinates are calculated. \n",
    "* The only adjustment for the distance calculation is the footprint. We do not need to make adjustment for the overlap or sidelap.\n",

    "The following is the calculation for the horizontal footprint as a function of camera angle in the x-direction (angle_x_deg) and the field of view in the x-direction (FOV_x). The calculation for the vertical footprint as a function of angle_y_deg is analogous.\n",
    "\n",
    "If camera_angle_x >= 0, We have two cases:\n",
    "* If camera_angle_x >= FOV_x / 2, then `horizontal_footprint = (tan(camera_angle_x + FOV_x/2) - tan(camera_angle_x - FOV_x/2)) * height`\n",
    "* If 0 <= camera_angle_x < FOV_x/2, then `horizontal_footprint = (tan(camera_angle_x + FOV_x/2) + tan(FOV_x/2 - camera_angle_x)) * height`\n",

    "But tan() is an odd function. By using this fact, we know that tan(FOV_x/2 - camera_angle_x) is the same as - tan(camera_angle_x - FOV_x/2), \n",
    "which means that the two formulas above are the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, by using the fact that tan() is an odd function again, we know that when camera angle_x < 0, we still get the same equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "So either of the above equations would work whenever camera_angle_x satisfies the condition that FOV_x/2 + abs(camera_angle_x) < 90 degrees.\n",

    "We assume the drone can change direction without loss of speed, such as at the end of each row of the lawnmower flight pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the variables as follows:\n",
    "* acceleration $a = 3.5 m/s^2$\n",
    "* $v_{max} = 16 m/s$\n",
    "* $v_1$ = speed at waypoint\n",
    "* $D$ = distance between waypoints\n",
    "* $T$ = time between waypoints\n",
    "\n",
    "We also assume that max deceleration = - max acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case 1: Assume the distance $D$ between waypoints is far enought so $v_{max}$ is attained\n",
    "In this case, we can breakdown the calculation into three sections:\n",
    "* accelerating from $v_1$ to $v_{max}$, for a distance of $d_1$ with time $t_1$\n",
    "* travelling with speed of $v_{max}$, for a distance of $d_2$ with  time $t_2$\n",
    "* decelerating from $v_{max}$ to $v_1$, for a distance of $d_3$ with time $t_3$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculation of distance and time with constant acceleration from a speed of $v_1$ to a speed of $v_{max}$.\n",
    "Let \n",
    "$t_1$ = time during acceleration, \n",
    "and \n",
    "$\\Delta v = v_{max} - v_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $a * t_1 = \\Delta v$, so $t_1 = \\Delta v / a$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also by basic kinematics for constant acceleration, $d_1 = v_1  t_1 + (1/2) a t_1^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "After substitution, we get $d_1 = v_1 \\Delta v / a + (1/2) a (\\Delta v / a)^2 = v_1 \\Delta v / a + (1/2) (\\Delta v)^2 / a$\n",
    "\n",
    "By symmetry, during deceleration from $v_{max}$ to $v_1$, we would have $d_3 = d_1$ with time $t_3 = t_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $D = d_1 + d_2 + d_3$, the distance while travelling with \n",
    "a speed of $v_{max}$ would be $d_2 = D - 2 d_1$ with a time $t_2 = d_2 / v_{max}$\n",
    "\n",

    "and the calculation would only include two sections:\n",
    "* acceleration from $v_1$ to $v_2$, for a distance of $D/2$ with time $t_a$\n",
    "* deceleration from $v_2$ to $v_1$, for a distance of $D/2$ with time $t_b$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $t_a = t_b$ by symmetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculation of time with constant acceleration from a speed of $v_1$ to a speed of $v_2$.\n",
    "Let \n",
    "$t_a$ = time during acceleration, \n",
    "and \n",
    "$\\Delta v_a = v_2 - v_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $a t_a = \\Delta v_a$, so $t_a = \\Delta v_a / a$. \n",
    "\n",
    "By basic kinematics, $D/2 = v_1 t_a + (1/2) a t_a^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "After substitution, we have $D/2 = v_1 (\\Delta v_a / a) + (1/2) a (\\Delta v_a / a)^2 = v_1 (v_2 - v_1) / a + (1/2) (v_2 - v_1)^2 / a$\n",
    "\n",
    "After simplification, we get a maximum speed of $v_2 = \\sqrt{aD + v_1^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "So $t_a = (v_2 - v_1) / a = (\\sqrt{aD + v_1^2} - v_1) / a$ \n",

    "## Function: compute_image_footprint_on_surface_coord() in src/camera_utils.py\n",
    "In my visualization, I wanted to show the footprint corresponding to each waypoint for non-nadir camera angles. In order to do that, I created this new function to calculate coordinates of the footprint relative to the camera's position. This also calculates the coordinate on the footprint corresponding to the center of the camera's view (which will not be at the center of the footprint when the angle is non-zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function: closest_distance_to_footprint() in  src/camera/utils.py\n",
    "After a discussion with Ayush, I learned that I need to consider the closest point on the footprint when I calculate the waypoint speed to avoid motion blue. So I created this function to calculate that distance. This distance will be the same as the drone height when angle is small enough so that the drone is flying over any part of the footprint. However, when the angle is big enough so that the drone is not directly over any part of the footprint, this function will calculate the shortest distance from the drone to any point on the footprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function: plot_photo_plan_with_area() in src/visualization.py\n",
    "In my visualization, I wanted to overlay the rectangular regions of the photos over the plot with just the flight path with waypoints. So I created this function to add the rectangles over the original plot. It took a while to turn the transparency of the colors and color so that the visualization will not be too dark. I also used different colors to represent the footprint for different waypoints, so I use the hue-saturation-value scale so that the hues can recycle.\n"

    "In this project, I learned that the attempt at creating visualization can help uncover hidden assumptions that I have in my thinking. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when I first added the non-nadir camera angles, I assumed the footprint will remain relatively rectangular. But during the process of creating the visualization, I was forced to think through the details of the situation, and I realized the distortion to the shape of the footprint may be so large that the footprint will be far from rectangular when the angle is large. \n"
